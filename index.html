      <h2>Alphonse</h2>
        <img class="al-pic" src="images/alphonse.jpg" alt="alphonse">
        <p>Alphonse, the more timid of the two, is the younger brother. Although he is the timid one, he is the most vocal. He is the one who instigates all the meowing when they know it is time for them to eat. He does not as cuddly as Edward, but when he does, it is a definite sign of his affection.</p>

    <div class="edward">
      <h2 class="ed">Edward</h2>
      <img class="ed-pic" src="images/edward.jpg" alt="edward" width="300" height="425" />
      <p>The alpha cat. Edward's favorite activity is showing his dominance over his younger brother in any scuffle they get into. Although he may not start their skirmishes, he <b>definitely finishes them</b> with pinning his brother down any chance he gets. Edward likes to cuddle with anyone and will purr loudly when he's petted.</p>

    <p>I found <a href="https://mycatkyle.com">this</a> website to be good. There were a lot of things confusing. I found many layers and layers of the div element and spent a long time trying to find the main parts of the site. It looks like some of the styling was not all done via CSS because I can see, in the HTML, that some of the styling was written in there. This makes me curious and excited to learn CSS.</p>
